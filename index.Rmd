## Teaching

At St. Lawrence University, I have taught Introduction to Statistics, Regression Modeling, Data Science (in-development course materials are given <a href="https://highamm.github.io/datascience234/" target="_blank"> here</a> ), and co-taught a senior year seminar on data visualization. 

## Other

In my free time, I enjoy playing racket sports `r emo::ji("tennis")`, jogging `r emo::ji("runner")`, gaming `r emo::ji("video-game")`, hiking `r emo::ji("mountain")`, and backpacking `r emo::ji("backpack")`!
