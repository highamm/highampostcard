## Bio

Matt Higham studies spatial statistics with ecological applications. His focus is spatial prediction models with imperfect detection of animals in surveys. He is an Assistant Professor at St. Lawrence University and earned a PhD degree in Statistics from Oregon State University in 2019 and B.S. degrees in Statistics and Botany from Miami University in 2014.

## Teaching

At St. Lawrence University, I have taught Introduction to Statistics, Regression Modeling, Data Science (in-development course materials are given <a href="https://highamm.github.io/datascience234/" target="_blank"> here</a>), and co-taught a senior year seminar on data visualization. 

## Other

In my free time, I enjoy playing racket sports `r emo::ji("tennis")`, jogging `r emo::ji("runner")`, gaming `r emo::ji("video_game")`, hiking `r emo::ji("mountain")`, and backpacking `r emo::ji("backpack")`!
